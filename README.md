<h2> Description & Features</h2>
What it does is watch everything players type in chat and keeps a log of it, with timestamps and who said what. That way, the server always has a record.

But hereâ€™s the cool part: it has a feature called Big Brother, not creepy, just funny name, it checks messages for words or phrases that the server doesnâ€™t want people saying. If it spots one, it automatically flags the message and alerts any moderators online. So mods donâ€™t have to be staring at chat all the time; they get a heads-up when someone might be breaking the rules.

Everything it flags gets logged separately too, so you can go back and see exactly what was said and when. And the words it flags? You can change them yourself in a simple config.yml file. Right now itâ€™s pretty basic, but it works, and Iâ€™m thinking of improving how the logs are organized maybe by player, by day, or some other way that makes it easier to track things. 

Basically, itâ€™s a simple tool for keeping chat clean and helping moderators stay on top of things without doing all the work themselves.
-  **Banned Words/Phrases** â€“ Easily configurable in `config.yml` just configure what words or phrases you want flagged. 
-  **Big Brother System** â€“ Real-time notifications to moderators- This is the ingame notfication to server staff
-  **Logging** â€“ Dated, timestamped, and player-tagged logs (Working on improving further)
